# Crevall : Reverse shell Generator for C languages
an advanced python script used to generate reverse shell of all types that are created with C language.
The payload(reverse _shell) generated can be used on multiple platforms to attack on, example = windows, linux, etc.
No extra packages for python are needed except for the requests package.
Installation of requests package
# For python
          pip install requests
# For python3 
          pip3 install requests
          
There's no need for the attacker to create a c reverse shell and then take more time in finding bugs in the program.
This may be very time consuming.
This script is pre-tested on our systems & are ready to use.
