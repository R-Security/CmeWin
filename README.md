# CmeWin : Reverse shell for Windows Platform
This is a python written script that generates C reverse shell used for Windows platform specifically. CmeWIN, the name itself tells about the program. It generates C reverse shell for Windows according to the user's target's ip and port, which means there isn't any need for opening the file and editing and saving it back which could lead to some accidental errors.
Executing this script is really very simple, you just need to have 1 package installed & that's called requests
# for Python
              pip install requests
# for python3:
              pip3 install requests

The payload will be generated in your current working directory with a name of "CmeWIN.c".
Another great thing about this file is it generates the payload already in the .c extension, there's no need to download a .txt and then convert it to .c files.
